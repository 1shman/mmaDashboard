[View the Dashboard!](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ishraq.rahman/viz/ufc_17293677085580/Dashboard1)

This project involves the development of an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes and visualizes UFC fight data retrieved from a Kaggle dataset and cleaned through MySQL. The dashboard provides insights into fight conclusion methods, fighter demographics, match metrics, and performance correlations.

## The dashboard consists of four key visualizations:

- **Fight Conclusion Methods (Pie Chart):**
  - Displays the distribution of fight outcomes such as knockout (KO), submission, and decision
- **Fighter Demographics (Bar Chart):**
  - Counts the number of male and female fighters who have competed in the UFC
- **Match and Event Statistics (Summary Chart):**
  - Presents the total number of UFC matches, the countries where they were hosted, and the unique weight classes involved
- **Winning Odds vs Strikes Landed (Scatter Plot):**
  - Plots the correlation between a winning fighterâ€™s odds and the average strikes landed per minute to uncover performance insights

## Features
- **Data Source:** UFC dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset/data) and cleaned via MySQL Workbench
- **Visualizations:** Interactive charts in Tableau to enable data exploration
- **Insights:** Provides a comprehensive view of fight results, fighter demographics, event metrics, and performance analysis.
